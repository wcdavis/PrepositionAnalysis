The New McGuffey First Reader

October, 1998  [Etext #1489]


**The Project Gutenberg Etext of The New McGuffey First Reader**
******This file should be named 1nmcg10.txt or 1nmcg10.zip******

Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, 1nmcg11.txt
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, 1nmcg10a.txt

Etext prepared by Dianne Bean of Phoenix, Arizona. The book
contained diacritical markings, music notations, and samples of
handwriting, which have been omitted in this ascii etext. There
were several torn pages which are noted by [missing words]. If
you have a good copy and would like to fill in the blanks or add
the engravings to this etext, please contact Project Gutenberg.

Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we do NOT keep these books
in compliance with any particular paper edition, usually otherwise.


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, for time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month, or 384 more Etexts in 1998 for a total of 1500+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 150 billion Etexts given away.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the etext (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Project of 20% of the
     net profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Association/Carnegie-Mellon
     University" within the 60 days following each
     date you prepare (or were legally required to prepare)
     your annual (or equivalent periodic) tax return.

WHAT IF YOU *WANT* TO SEND MONEY EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO?
The Project gratefully accepts contributions in money, time,
scanning machines, OCR software, public domain etexts, royalty
free copyright licenses, and every other sort of contribution
you can think of.  Money should be paid to "Project Gutenberg
Association / Carnegie-Mellon University".

THE NEW MCGUFFEY FIRST READER





PREFACE

The New  McGuffey First Reader has been prepared in
conformity with the latest and most approved ideas regarding
the teaching of reading, and its lessons embody and illustrate
the best features of the word, the phonic, and the sentence or
thought methods.

While all the stories in this book are new, or have been
rewritten especially for its pages, care has been taken to
preserve the distinguishing characteristics which have given
to the McGuffey Readers their unparalleled popularity and
usefulness.

The gradation both in thought and in words has been carefully
maintained, and the work provided enables the pupils
to advance by easy and evenly progressive stages from the
beginning to the end.

Only a few new words are introduced at each lesson, and
these are repeated frequently in succeeding lessons until the
pupils are able to recognize them without difficulty.

From the first lesson script is presented in connection with
the printed forms of words, the frequency of its use diminishing
as the printed forms become more familiar.

The sounds of the letters are taught, in the order of the
alphabet, by appropriate exercises after the various reading
lessons. The phonic elements and the common diacritical
marks are learned one at a time and in a manner that is both
natural and easy.

It is the picture of my pet kitten.

Do you not think she is a pretty pet?

One morning as I was going to
school, I found this kitten.

She was by a tree in the woods.

After school I took her home.

"Mother," I said, "see this pretty
little kitten. May I keep her as a pet?"

Mother said, "You may keep her if
you will take good care of her."

I am kind to my kitten.

I feed her and she loves me.

REVIEW.

My mother gave me a new book.

I took it to school one morning,
to let the girls see the pictures.

Soon after this I found my pet kitten
and took her home with me.

I like to play with my pet kitten.

I will do as mother says. I will
take good care of the kitten.

I love little Lucy. But now she has
gone far away to her home.

I like to see John run with his kite.

He can run as fast as the other boys,
but he can not jump far.

He does not like to look at books
and pictures, but he can play on a drum.

It was not in a nest.

If you will give me one of your

One morning when the sun was
warm these children went out
to take a walk.

Do you know who they are?

I see May and Rose and little Lucy.

There are two other girls with them,
but I do not know their names.

They took a little wagon with them,
and went up the hill.

They went to the field on the hill to
find some violets.

They found some sunflowers in the
field, but violets do not grow there.

They saw a wild rose, but a busy
bee was on it.

"Now," said Lucy, "let us go to the
well and see if it has water in it."

"Yes," said one of the other girls,
"the sun is too hot here. But if
we go to the well, you must take
care not to fall in."

"Oh, I will not fall in," said Lucy.

"I will look at the water far
down in the well; but I will not fall."

The girls will go home when the sun
goes down.

They are sweet apples.

I think I must have four cents

Oh, Frank! You want too much for

Well, then, children, I will tell

One warm day in June, Frank's

"Oh, father," said Frank, "I wish
I could go too. Will you let

"Yes, Frank. Run and; get your

"Thank you, father, I am so glad
that I may go."

Here is Frank at the river, with
his hook and line.

How bright the sun shines on the
water!

I wonder where all the fish have
gone. Frank can not see them.

The fish are far down in the water.

Frank has let his hook down, and
he wishes that a big fish would
come and take it.

But the fish do not wish him to
catch them to-day. They will
not come near the hook.

They sit in the shade of the tree
and listen to the birds that are

He has some good oars, too.

He keeps the oars at the house.

Sometimes little May goes out in

The water is not deep, and the
children will not fall out of the
boat. They like to row here
and there on the river.

John takes the oars, and May sits
in her place and tells him where
to go.

Sometimes each takes an oar. Then
the boat goes very fast.

John has a hook and line. But
when May is with him he does
not try to catch any fish.

He knows that May does not like

Here are all the boys coming up

are going to-day.

Each boy has a hook and a line,

I think they are going to get into
John's new boat and row out
on the river.

Can you tell which of these boys
is John?

They will get in the boat and row
far out on the water.

When they get to a deep place they
will try to catch some fish.

I wonder if any of the fish will come
near the boat.

Little Robin Redbreast has a nest
in our garden.

If you listen any time in the day,
you can hear him sing.

On warm days he likes to sit in the
shade among the green leaves.

He can see the busy bees when they
fly to the flowers to get honey.

He sees the green apples about him,
but he does not like them. He
would not eat them if they
were ripe and sweet.

At night he can look up from his
place in the tree and see the
bright stars in the sky. Some 
times he can see the moon, too,
as it shines above him.

Sometimes the Pussy Cat comes
under his tree and looks up at
him; but she can not get him.

She sits under the tree and wishes
that she could catch him.

Do you know why she wants the
bird? Do you know what she
would do if she could get him?

One day Henry went out to the field
behind the garden. He went
out to see his father plant corn.

He sat down by a tree and said,

"Thank you, my little boy," said his
father. "I want some help very
much. What can you do?"

"I should like to plant some corn.
How much will you give me?"

"I will give you four cents a day
if you work well. But now

"What is that?" said Rose as she
went down the garden walk.

She saw Frank at work under

"It is a little boat, Rose," said Frank.
"What do you think of this boat?"

"Oh, I think it is very pretty. Where
did you get it, Frank?"

"I made it, Rose. I made it all."

"How glad I am that you made it!
Will it float in the water?"

"I think so. All it wants now is the 
sail. I will soon put that on."

"How I should like to see it sail!
Does mother know  that you
have made it?"

"Not yet; but I will take it to her
as soon as I have put the sail on it.

Then, if she will let us, we will take
it down to the river. We will
put it in the water and see it
float. We will see how fast it
can sail."

Soon Frank and Rose were on their
way to the river. Frank said
that if the boat sailed well, he
would give it to Rose.

She will let her doll sail in it.

Oh, I can tell you. After the
summer is gone, fall will come.

When fall comes, the days begin
to grow cold.

Then the leaves fall from the trees.

Some of the leaves turn red, some
turn brown, and some turn
yellow as gold.

In the fall we have ripe apples to
eat. The corn is ripe then, too.

All the children are glad when fall
comes. Do you know why?

Play time is over, and school begins.

rain stay grass fresh

"I wish, mother, you would tell me
where the rain comes from.

"Does it come from the sky?

"Are the leaves and the flowers and
the grass glad when the rain
falls on them?"

This is what Lucy asked her mother
one day. Her mother said:

"The rain makes the grass look
green and fresh. It helps the
flowers grow.

"The corn which we plant in the
field could not grow if there
was no rain."

"But, mother," said Lucy, "I do not
like the rain very well. It
makes me stay in the house
when I want to go and play.

See how fast it rains! I shall have
to stay at home all day."

evening west clouds those fade

It is evening, and the sun is about to
set. The day will soon be gone.

Let us sit here on the soft grass
and look at the bright clouds
in the west.

Do you think there is any rain in
those little clouds?

Oh, no! Those are not rain clouds.

See how pretty they are!

Some of the clouds are red, and
some are as yellow as gold.

It is the light of the sun that makes
them look so bright.

Soon they will all fade away in the
blue sky.

Soon it will be night, and the moon
and stars will shine for us.

ship sea beach sand live shells

Here are four little girls who live
near the sea.

They have gone down to the
beach with their father.

They like to play in the sand.

Sometimes their mother goes with
them, and they stay there all day.

They like to look at the ships as
they sail far away on the blue sea.

Do you think you would like to
sail far away on a ship?

Sometimes these little girls find
pretty shells in the sand.

I think all children like to play
on the beach when the sun is warm,
and the wind does not blow.

only every use driver

What does the man say?

He says, "Good sweet apples,
only two cents each! Ripe, sweet
apples, yellow as gold! Who will
buy my apples this warm summer
morning?"

You can hear him as he goes
down the road. "Who wants to
buy a nice red apple?"

The apples are in the wagon.

The man walks in the road, behind
the wagon, and tells every one that
he has apples to sell.

His little dog rides in the wagon
and looks at the horse.

Is he not a funny driver?

The horse does not go very fast.

He knows that his driver can not
use a whip..

"Oh, who wants to buy some
good apples this bright summer
morning?"

just hand told town brother

Do you know these three boys?

The tall boy in the wagon is
Frank Brown. The little boy is
Henry. He is Frank's brother.

The boy on the horse is John
Day. See how well he can ride!

Frank is a good driver. He sits
in the wagon, and the horse goes
just as he is told.

Frank has a whip in his hand,
but he does not use it.

Henry's little dog runs behind.
Sometimes he has to run very fast
to keep up with the wagon.

Do you know where the boys are
going?

I think they are going to town.

I wonder what they will buy in
town.

Henry says he will buy a book
with pretty pictures in it. He can
not read very well, but he likes to
look at books.

John wants to ride down to the
river and look at the boats. He
would buy a new boat if he could.
But he has only one cent, and what
can he buy with that?

Frank says they will not stay in
town long. They must go home
very soon.

happy often ask bow arrow Robert

The name of this little boy is
Robert. He is a busy boy.

He lives in a big town, and he 
does not often see  the fields and
the green woods.

Yet he is just as happy as Frank
and John and little Henry.

He lives in a tall house not far
from the river. In the summer
time he can see the ships as they
sail up the river.

His father has a boat, and sometimes
Robert goes sailing in it.

One day Robert saw a man with 
[Missing text] bows and arrows to sell.
 
"How much do you ask for your
arrows?" he said.

"[Missing text] three cents each," said the 
man. "Would you like to buy one?"

Robert did not buy an arrow.
He went home and made one
that was just as good.

Do you think he can use it?

{Missing text] teacher says that he must
{Missing text] bow now.

What does the summer
bring? Green leaves, pretty

birds of many kinds.
It is then that we play in
the woods and by the sea.

winter north ice snow brings short shiver

When winter comes, the days are
short and the nights are long.

Then the cold north wind blows
over the fields and woods.

It blows over the meadow and
the river and the high hills.

It brings snow and ice.

It makes our hands and faces
cold. We do not like the north
wind.

All children are happy when winter
comes. They like to see the
snow. They like to play on the ice.

They do not care if the north
wind does make them shiver. Those
who are dressed warm do not feel
the cold very much.

Sometimes the snow is so deep
they can not go to school.

In the evening, they sit in the
warm house and read and play.

room window white story show

It is very cold to day, but the
snow is not deep. All the boys
and girls are at school.

The school room is warm and
bright, and the children are happy.

You can see them at their places
in the school room.

They look out of the window and
see the snow falling. How soft and
white it is!

The teacher has been showing the
children some pictures in her new
book. Now she is telling them a
story that is found in it.

The children look and listen.
They do not think how cold it is
out of doors.

clock  minute  call things
hour round tick tack

Can you tell what time it
is? Look at the clock, and
then tell me.

The clock has a round face.

It has two hands.

We call the long hand the
minute hand, for it tells the
minutes.

We call the short hand the hour
hand, for it tells the hours.

How many hours are there in a
day? How many minutes in an hour?

If you listen, you can hear what the
clock says. Tick, tack, tick, tack.

Our clock at school tells us many
things.   It tells us when to work
and when to play.

Tick, tack, tick, tack, tick, tack, tick, tack, Little clock

Tells me when the right hours are, For eating, for sleeping,
for play and all, For rising and bathing, it sounds the call;
Beat by beat with forward, back, Ever tick and ever tack.

TO BE MEMORIZED.

Children who may read my lay,
This much I have to say;
Each day and every day
Do what is right.
Right things in great or small;
Then, though the sky should fall,
Sun, moon, and stars and all,
You shall have light.
