This directory contains the code, data, and charts and graphs used in this project. 
In the REPORT directory, you will find my tex and pdf files, as well as all the 
graphics present in the file. In the TEXTS directory, you will find all the text 
files I used as my corpus. They have kept their original file names, in accordance to
the wishes of Project Gutenberg. In the CODE directory, you will find the Python and
MATLAB code and weird files that I've used to help me get things done for this 
research. In the DATA directory, you will find the SQLite database, the Excel 
workbook, CSV files, and assorted MATLAB stuff that contains the collected data.

Happy reading!
